# Database Plan

Given the constraints of the Bolt environment, we recommend using SQLite as the database solution for this project. SQLite is a lightweight, serverless database that can be easily integrated into web applications.

Key points:
1. SQLite can be used directly in the browser environment.
2. It doesn't require a separate database server, making it suitable for the Bolt environment.
3. It supports most SQL features needed for this project.

Implementation steps:
1. Use the `sql.js` library, which is a port of SQLite to WebAssembly, allowing SQLite to run in the browser.
2. Set up the database schema to include tables for users, groups, VoIP data, SMS data, calendar events, and configuration settings.
3. Implement data access layers for each module to interact with the database.
4. Ensure proper indexing and query optimization for performance.
5. Implement a backup and export system to allow data persistence across sessions.

Note: While SQLite is suitable for development and testing, for a production environment with multiple concurrent users, you might need to consider a more robust, server-based solution in the future.
