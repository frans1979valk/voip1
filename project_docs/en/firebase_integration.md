# Firebase Integration Plan

We will use Firebase for development, with the option to switch to a different backend solution later if needed. Here's the plan for integrating Firebase:

1. Firebase Services to Use:
   - Authentication: For user management and authentication
   - Firestore: For storing application data (users, groups, settings, etc.)
   - Storage: For storing files and documents
   - Cloud Functions: For server-side logic (if needed)

2. Integration Steps:
   a. Install Firebase SDK in the project
   b. Initialize Firebase with the provided configuration
   c. Set up Firebase Authentication for user management
   d. Design Firestore database structure for the application data
   e. Implement Firebase Storage for file management
   f. Set up Cloud Functions for any necessary server-side operations

3. Security:
   - Implement proper security rules in Firestore and Storage
   - Use environment variables for Firebase config in production

4. Data Migration Plan:
   - Design a data export feature from Firebase
   - Create a migration script for potential future backend changes

Note: The Firebase configuration is stored in `config/firebase_config.json`. Ensure this file is not publicly accessible in production environments.

We will update relevant module prompts to include Firebase integration where necessary.
