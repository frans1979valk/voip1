# Version Control and Backup Plan

1. Git Repository Setup:
   - Initialize a Git repository at the project root.
   - Create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files.

2. Branching Strategy:
   - main: Stable, production-ready code.
   - develop: Integration branch for features.
   - feature/[feature-name]: For developing new features.

3. Commit Strategy:
   - Make small, focused commits.
   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages.

4. When to Save/Commit:
   - After completing each module.
   - After implementing a significant feature within a module.
   - Before and after making major architectural changes.
   - At the end of each development session.

5. Tagging:
   - Use semantic versioning (e.g., v1.0.0).
   - Tag after completing major milestones or releases.

6. Backup:
   - Perform weekly backups of the entire project directory.
   - Store backups in a secure, off-site location.

7. Pull Requests:
   - Use pull requests for code review before merging features into develop.

8. Documentation:
   - Keep a CHANGELOG.md file updated with all significant changes.

Remember: Commit early, commit often. It's easier to revert small changes than big ones.
