[Existing content remains]

Firebase Integration:
1. Store VoIP configuration settings in Firestore
2. Use Firebase Cloud Functions for server-side VoIP operations if necessary
3. Implement real-time monitoring using Firestore's real-time capabilities
4. Store call logs and analytics data in Firestore

Ensure that the VoIP functionality can work alongside Firebase, potentially using Firebase for authentication and data storage while keeping the core VoIP operations separate.
