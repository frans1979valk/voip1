# Base UI Framework

Develop a responsive and customizable UI framework with the following components:

1. Responsive layout that works on desktop and mobile devices
2. Navigation system with menu items based on user roles
3. Theming system with per-group customization:
   - Logo management
   - Color scheme configuration
   - Button style adjustments
4. Configuration interface for Superadmin to manage themes
5. Reusable UI components (buttons, forms, tables, etc.)
6. Responsive grid system
7. Typography system
8. Error pages:
   - Design and implement custom error pages for common HTTP status codes (400, 404, 500)
   - Ensure error pages are informative, user-friendly, and consistent with the overall design
   - Include clear explanations of the error in Dutch
   - Provide helpful suggestions or actions for the user to take

Ensure that the UI is user-friendly and adheres to modern web design principles. All text in the interface should be in Dutch.

Additional Requirement:
Keep a thorough record of all development activities, decisions, and progress in a file named 'base_ui_framework_log.md'. This log should be updated consistently with:
- Implementation details of each UI component
- Design choices and their rationale
- Challenges faced during responsive design and their resolutions
- User feedback and iterative improvements
- Any modifications or extensions to the initial requirements
- Specific notes on the design and implementation of error pages

Ensure that this log provides a clear narrative of the UI framework's evolution throughout the development process.
