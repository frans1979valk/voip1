# VoIP Module

Implement a VoIP system with the following features:

1. Server-side VoIP gateway setup
2. VoIP configuration interface in superadmin dashboard
3. Real-time monitoring system:
   - Metrics collection (call quality, latency, etc.)
   - Alerting system for issues
   - Monitoring dashboard with real-time and historical data
4. Client-side VoIP implementation using WebRTC
5. Logging and analysis system for calls
6. Integration with user management for call permissions
7. Call recording functionality (optional)

Ensure that the VoIP system is reliable, secure, and provides high-quality audio. The user interface should be in Dutch.

VoIP Server Setup Steps:
1. Choose a VoIP server software (e.g., Asterisk, FreeSWITCH)
2. Provision a server with adequate resources (CPU, RAM, bandwidth)
3. Install and configure the chosen VoIP server software
4. Set up SIP trunks for external connectivity
5. Configure extensions and dial plans
6. Implement security measures (firewall rules, encryption)
7. Set up monitoring and logging
8. Perform initial testing and troubleshooting
9. Document the server configuration and maintenance procedures

Note: The VoIP server should be set up after the User Management and Base UI Framework modules are completed, but before implementing the client-side VoIP functionality. This ensures that user authentication and basic UI components are in place before integrating VoIP features.

Additional Requirement:
Maintain a comprehensive log of all development activities, decisions, and progress in a file named 'voip_module_log.md'. This log should be regularly updated with:
- Technical details of VoIP integration
- Configuration choices for the VoIP gateway
- Challenges in implementing real-time monitoring and their solutions
- Performance metrics and optimization efforts
- Any adjustments or additions to the original specifications
- Detailed notes on the VoIP server setup process and configuration

Ensure that this log serves as a detailed technical reference for the VoIP module's implementation and can aid in future maintenance and upgrades.
